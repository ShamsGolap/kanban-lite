# Kanban-Lite

This is a mini-project initially planned for me. I'd like to use some kanban tables to organize some of my projects.
So I decided to create a public project which could be used by other people.

## Usage: 

- Firstly, just clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/ShamsGolap/kanban-lite.git`

- Then launch the index.html on your favorite browser.

- Create / Choose / Remove a project. Add / Remove ideas. Manage stuff in columns. Delete "done" things when you think it's time.

##Â Work In Progress!
For the first part, you'll have to copy/paste a given encrypted-like code to get back your stuff in the project.
It'll be stored in a temporary JSON.

The table can't be saved for now because I don't use any server-side part (which is needed to save stuff on a file).

I'm just getting my ideas, so the app is not done yet.
